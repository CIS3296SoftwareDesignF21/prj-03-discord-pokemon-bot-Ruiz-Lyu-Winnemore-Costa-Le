## UML Class Diagram
Launch is a class used on first instance of the game.  The user will pick from indexed list of base characters and then enter a customizable player name as a string.  The main character class extends
the launch class and will pass the name variable and allow for further unique characteristics for the chosen main character.  These characteristics include id, gender
badge count, money, and changes to name.  The Pokedex holds boolean variables for Pokemon as discovered/undiscovered and caught/not caught.  Moves of Pokemon are also associated with the Pokemon class.  In the scenario of a wild encounter the option
to catch is an available move type.
