## UML Sequence Diagram
This sequence diagram maps out an instance where a user activates a bot on
the discord server.  From here the individual will select a username to login.
The user will then have the option to use commands like pokedex, change location,
and battle.  The battle will be interactive, displaying damages and asking for move input.
A catch function will be associated with the battle/encounter and displays an event output.
