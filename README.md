# How to Install

Persona- High school student
Joey, a highschool student:
Joey, age 16, is an average high school sophomore who enjoys playing video games in his free time and keeping up with his friends. Like many others of his age he uses discord servers to stay in touch with friends. Whether they’re friends that go to his school or they’re friends he has made from all around the world on public servers, Joey has places for both of them.
Although he is familiar with and uses discord quite often he is not a particularly technically savvy person and has no use for apps that require a lot of fine tuning and hard to understand command inputs and those that are harder to install than say going to a link, hitting install and having everything set up for you.
Joey like many people grew up under the influence of the biggest media franchise Pokémon and developed a nostalgic attachment to the brand and all things that incorporate it. Even though he could just continue playing the games the same way he’s always played them he’s open to trying the game in a new shape or form that would perhaps reignite his passion for the games but in a more casual less focused sense.


Persona- Young child (age 5 to 8) 

Aston, age 6, is a first grade student at an elementary school in Baltimore, Maryland.  He was born into a family that has surrounded him with
technology from a young age.  He is able to easily use a phone for the following tasks; phone calls, facetime, scrolling through photos, and 
playing simple games.  At school Aston is learning how to write three and four letter words, basic mathematical operations, and how to interact
socially.  Some of his friends at school really like the game of Pokemon.  Aston wants to play Pokemon too and enjoy his time with the other 
kids.  

Aston doesn't have a personal phone or any other device to play Pokemon on but he does have access to the family computer.  With this internet 
connection he can access discord and the Pokemon bot that is being developed by our group.  Aston can easily interact with the software because
the keyword commands are simple.  He is able to move around the map and catch Pokemon with one or two clicks on a keyboard.  This allows him to
join in on the fun with friends and experience all that the game of Pokemon has to offer.
