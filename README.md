# Project Description & Vision Statement

-What is the product to be developed?

The product to be developed is a discord oriented Pokemon game.  It will utilize a discord bot to provide a visual map as well as an interactive
user interface to move around, catch pokemon, and battle others.

-Who are the target customers and users?

The target consumer is children ages 5-14 while there should also be some appeal to older individuals who seek a nostalgic Pokemon experience.

-Why should customers buy this product?

Consumers should use this product because it offers a fully sufficient experience all in discord.  The set up is minimal and is accessible to
anyone with an internet connection and free discord account.
