# Pokemon Discord Bot
This software aims to be a Pokemon game that provides an interactive user interface through the discord api and servers.  The game facilitates town selection, user selection, trainer cards,
wild Pokemon encounters, and a Pokedex.  This project was built for a target consumer of children ages 5-14 and the hope that it may also garner appeal from older individuals seeking a nostalgic Pokemon experience.  This game differentiates itself from others on the market in its low barriers to usage.  The game requires minimal set up
and only requires a free discord account to use.
