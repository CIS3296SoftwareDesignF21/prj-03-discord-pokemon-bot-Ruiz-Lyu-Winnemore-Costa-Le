# How to Run
This project will eventually be run 24/7 on replit but its commands can be accessed on any discord server that the bot resides in, for now it exists only at https://discord.gg/8HatSCxCxR

# How to Install


Persona- Young child (age 5 to 8) 

Aston, age 6, is a first grade student at an elementary school in Baltimore, Maryland.  He was born into a family that has surrounded him with
technology from a young age.  He is able to easily use a phone for the following tasks; phone calls, facetime, scrolling through photos, and 
playing simple games.  At school Aston is learning how to write three and four letter words, basic mathematical operations, and how to interact
socially.  Some of his friends at school really like the game of Pokemon.  Aston wants to play Pokemon too and enjoy his time with the other 
kids.  

Aston doesn't have a personal phone or any other device to play Pokemon on but he does have access to the family computer.  With this internet 
connection he can access discord and the Pokemon bot that is being developed by our group.  Aston can easily interact with the software because
the keyword commands are simple.  He is able to move around the map and catch Pokemon with one or two clicks on a keyboard.  This allows him to
join in on the fun with friends and experience all that the game of Pokemon has to offer.


Vision Statement 
-What is the product to be developed?
The product to be developed is a discord oriented Pokemon game.  It will utilize a discord bot to provide a visual map as well as an interactive
user interface to move around, catch pokemon, and battle others.
-Who are the target customers and users?
The target consumer is children ages 5-14 while there should also be some appeal to older individuals who seek a nostalgic Pokemon experience.  
-Why should customers buy this product?
Consumers should use this product because it offers a fully sufficient experience all in discord.  The set up is minimal and is accessible to 
anyone with an internet connection and free discord account.
